# TITANIC-kaggle-competition-
This is my first kaggle competition

The way I worked on it followed these steps...

EDA
Checking data distribution to see which features might be relevant

Cleaning
I removed features that seemed irrelevant, and the treatment I gave to null values ​​was to use the median and the mean so as not to lose any data

Feature engineering
The name column contains a "marker" indicating whether it's male/boy or female/girl; I extracted these to see if they had any relevance.

Modeling
I used the following inference algorithms:
random forest classifier
logistic regression
svm
mlp
catboosting
xgboosting
